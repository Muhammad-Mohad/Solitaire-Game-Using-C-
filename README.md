A simple console based solitaire game

Just run the main.cpp and then move cards using the following commands:

-> move number of cards from one column to another by command like "m c1 c2 3"

-> move a single card from stockpile to wastepile with command "s"

-> move a card from column to foundation by command like "m c1 f2"

-> move a card from foundation to column by command like "m f1 c5"

-> move a card from wastepile to column by command like "m w c4"

-> automatically move a valid from wastepile to respective foundation by command "w"

-> undo is by command "z"

-> exit the game by "exit" command

(a very little error handling is done so yeah play it carefully and do not use undo more than once after a single move lol)
